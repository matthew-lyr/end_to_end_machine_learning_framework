# End-to-end Machine Learning Framework on Google Cloud Platform

### Overview
This project provides a simply way to implement a scalable machine learning system on Google Cloud Platform that handles on-going data cleaning, model training, model updating, and prediction for large-scale structured data.

### Special Features
1. Able to make large-scale batch predictions for more than hundreds of millions of records. 
2. Data cleaning and preparation is simple and straight-forward: use SQL to describe how data needs to be prepared.
3. Trained models can be easily re-trained and updated periodically.

### How it works
