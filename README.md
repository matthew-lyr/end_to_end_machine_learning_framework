# End-to-end Machine Learning Framework on Google Cloud Platform

### Overview
This project provides a simply way to implement a scalable machine learning system that handles on-going data cleaning, model training, model updating, and prediction for large-scale structured data.

### Special Features
1. Able to do large-scale batch predictions. It works nicely in usecases where predictions need to be made on hundreds of millions of records. 
2. Data messaging is simple and straight-forward: just use SQL to describe how data needs to be prepared.
3. Trained models can be easily replaced or updated periodically.
